Encryptor Refactoring Kata
==========================

Can you spot any smells in this code? Any violations of the SOLID design principles? It could certainly do with some tests, in any case.

Feel free to change public method signature and/or move methods to other public classes, so long as all the same functionality is available when you're done.
